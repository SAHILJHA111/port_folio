                    <p>Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was that she was growing next to an ugly cactus.
                        Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus about his looks, all while the cactus remained...</p>

                        Yesterday, he watched as a young boy helped an older man carry a heavy basket. Today, he saw a young girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw, the less he spoke.

                    <p>A farmer needed a water source for his farm, so he bought a well from his neighbor. However, The neighbor was cunning. The next day, as the farmer came to draw water from his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any.

                        When the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, “I sold you the well, not the water,” and walked away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for justice. He explained what had happened.
                        
                        The emperor called on ...

                    <p>A lone elephant walked through the forest, looking for friends. She soon saw a monkey and asked, “Can we be friends, monkey?”

                        The monkey quickly replied, “You are big and can’t swing on trees like I do, so I cannot be your friend.”
                        
                        Deflated, the elephant continued to search and stumbled across a rabbit. She asked him, “Can we be friends, rabbit?”
                        
                        The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to fit...

                    <p>One day, a fox became very hungry. He went out to search for some food. He searched high and low but couldn’t find anything to eat.

                        Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They were a rich purple, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.
                        
                        To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air...</p>

                    <h4>Story-6</h4>
                    <p>There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a satyr — a spirit of nature. Dionysus, the god of wine, then granted him a wish.

                        For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, so it was bestowed.
                        
                        Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all...</p>
